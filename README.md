# Data Structures

A Python-based project that demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures.  
This repository is developed for both academic learning and professional practice, aiming to build a solid foundation in data structure design.

## Description

This project showcases a clean implementation of data structures in Python.
The first one is a **Linked List**
It includes essential operations such as:
- Insertion at the beginning and end  
- Searching for a value  
- Removing nodes (beginning, end, or by specific data)  

Each function is written to clearly demonstrate how linked lists manage and connect data in memory, without using Pythonâ€™s built-in list type.  
The repository is structured to allow for easy expansion into more data structures such as **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Trees**, and more in future updates.
